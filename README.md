# language-learning-experiments

> Language learning and spaced repetition experiments.

## Project Structure

- `Experiments` contains directories with individual experiments

## Research Questions

- Is it possible to use a sparse sentence - word matrix or is such a matrix too large?
- What does a language learning app have to do at a high level?
- To what extent is instruction required? 
- Can learners infer grammar just based on a (word/phrase/sentence)-translation model of learning?
    - Given that we don't have formal instruction in the grammar of our primary languages and can speak them perfectly well, I'm confident the answer is yes. Though there is a quesiton of efficiency.
